        <p id="bio">My name is Zach Merel. I was born and raised in the Chicagoland area. I graduated from DePaul University where I
            got my BA in Accounting. While participating in the Northwestern Boot Camp program part-time I also work for
            a logistics firm part-time, where I help run the accounting department. Somethings I enjoy are reading, watching
            TV and movies, and spending time with friends.
